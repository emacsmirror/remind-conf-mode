Remind-conf-mode is a configuration mode designed to make it a little easier to configure remind using emacs.

It offers a vibrant colour syntax highlighting for those who like lots of colour, simple indentation and some hopefully useful functions for entering times and dates. Those functions have been exposed in a special menu for remind for those who have not turned off the emacs menu system.

Just copy remind-conf-mode.el to your elisp folder (whatever it is called) make sure it is in your path so emacs know where to look for it, and put (require 'remind-conf-mode) in your dotemacs file.

There are some more complex instructions in the file itself.

Have fun and if you can think of any improvements let me know, or fork it to your own git repository and experiment away.

The faux-locale branch has code for choosing the language you use remind in. Please try it out and let me know if there are any problems with it.
