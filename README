Remind-conf-mode is a configuration mode designed to make it a little easier to configure remind using emacs.

Just copy it to your elist folder (whatever it is called) make sure it is in your path so emacs know where to look for it, put (require 'remind-conf-mode) in your dotemacs file.

There are some more complex instructions in the file itself.

Have fun and if you can think of any improvements let me know, or fork it to your own git repository and experiment away.
